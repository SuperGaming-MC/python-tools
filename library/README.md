# downloading the python tools

you will need:
1. some sort of computer (A rasberry pi is ok)
2. (optional) git installed

**how to install***

install git
```bash
sudo apt install git
```
go to the command line and type in this command to clone the github repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperGaming-MC/python-tools
```
then cd into the directory python-tools
```bash
cd python-tools
```
then if you are using WSL you can do
```bash
explorer.exe .
```
to open up file explorer

if not cd into library and then cd into the tools directory you want to use

once done you can type
```bash
python3 (the name of the pyton file).py
```
you can check the name of the python file by doing
```bash
ls
```
